* Purpose
So this is a MIPS microprocessor simulator implemented in minikanren. It exists
because I felt like it. I think it's pretty cool tho tbqh fam. So like you can
like put a program into it and it'll give you a state of the microprocessor and
stuff. So that's cool. I dunno if I'm actually gonna follow through on this or
if it's just gonna be another project that I never actually complete. We'll find
out together. It'll be an adventure.
