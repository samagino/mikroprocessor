Okay, so we got general issues

* Represent Hardware or Represent Logic?
How faithfully should one try to represent the hardware of a MIPS processor?
Should one try to literally represent a machine, or should one instead build
machines that generate the same input/output relations of the physical
machines in a MIPS microprocessor?
** Current resolution
The latter, just build relations that generate the inputs/outputs seen in
their physical counterparts. Don't try to simulate electricity in able to
make an and gate, make a relation that represents what an and gate does as a
logical component. However, build everything from these logical components.

* Bugs
